# Zettels
Zettels is a command line tool implementing Niklas Luhmann's system of a 
"Zettelkasten".

# Anouncement: Reimplementation

This implementation of Zettels is no longer actively developed. Instead, I 
chose to reimplement Zettels from scratch in Rust.

While doing so, I added a lot of features and separated the command line 
interface from the backend, which is now a library called `libzettels`, 
sporting an API that can be used to easily build other user interfaces.
